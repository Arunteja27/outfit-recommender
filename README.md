## How It Works
**Wardrobe Analysis:** Upload your wardrobe to SmartWardrobe. Our machine learning models will analyze your clothes, understanding their colors and styles.

**Weather Integration:** Sync with real-time weather data to get accurate recommendations based on current conditions.

**Activity Planning:** Input your daily routine, and SmartWardrobe will suggest outfits suitable for each activity.

**Continuous Learning:** The more you use SmartWardrobe, the better it gets at understanding your preferences and suggesting outfits that match your style and needs.
