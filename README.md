Welcome to SmartWardrobe! This application is designed to help users decide what outfit to wear based on their current inventory of clothes, the weather conditions and their daily routine. SmartWardrobe leverages the power of machine learning to understand users' wardrobes, analyze clothing colors, and determine the suitability of clothes for different weather conditions, ensuring you are always dressed appropriately for the weather and your activities. Whether you're heading to a business meeting, hitting the gym, or enjoying a casual day out, SmartWardrobe has got you covered.
